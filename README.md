The list of awesome programming tools that can simplify and speed up everyday work. If you are looking for a tool then this list for you! Here you can find interesting programming tools that are not well known for someone, but can be very usefull. Feel free to make a contribution.

# Online tools
## Programming pads, online compilers, code playgrounds & IDEs:
- [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/) - DartPad is a free, open-source online editor to help developers learn about Dart and Flutter. 
- [DotNetFiddle](https://dotnetfiddle.net/) - If you are sick and tired of starting Visual Studio, creating a new project and running it, just to test simple code or try out samples from other developers you can use DotNetFiddle instead.

- [JsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) - JsFiddle is a JavaScript, CSS, HTML or CoffeeScript online code editor.
- [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) - Repl.it is a free, collaborative, in-browser IDE to code in 50+ languages â€” without spending a second on setup.
- [SharpLab](https://sharplab.io) - SharpLab is a .NET code playground that shows intermediate steps and results of code compilation. Some language features are thin wrappers on top of other features -- e.g. using() becomes try/finally. SharpLab allows you to see the code as compiler sees it, and get a better understanding of .NET languages. SharpLab supports three source languages: C#/VB/F#. There are currently three targets for decompilation/disassembly: C#/IL/JIT Asm. You can use "Run" target to execute your code and see the output.
- [TryHaxe](https://try.haxe.org/) - The Haxe online playground.
- [TryItOnline](https://tio.run/) - TIO is a family of online interpreters for an evergrowing list of practical and recreational programming languages. This services supports ~700 of programming languages
