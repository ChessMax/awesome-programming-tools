# Awesome programming tools
The list of awesome programming tools that can simplify and speed up everyday work. If you are looking for a tool then this list for you! Here you can find interesting programming tools that are not well known, but can be very usefull. Feel free to make a contribution.

# Online tools
## Programming pads, online compilers, code playgrounds & IDEs:
- [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/) - DartPad is a free, open-source online editor to help developers learn about Dart and Flutter. 
- [DotNetFiddle](https://dotnetfiddle.net/) - If you are sick and tired of starting Visual Studio, creating a new project and running it, just to test simple code or try out samples from other developers you can use DotNetFiddle instead.
- [JsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) - JsFiddle is a JavaScript, CSS, HTML or CoffeeScript online code editor.
- [Ohmlang Editor](https://ohmlang.github.io/editor/) - Online grammar editor that can visualize and explain your grammar.
- [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/) - The Rust Playground allows you to experiment with Rust before you install it locally, or in any other case where you might not have the compiler available.
- [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) - Repl.it is a free, collaborative, in-browser IDE to code in 50+ languages â€” without spending a second on setup.
- [SharpLab](https://sharplab.io) - SharpLab is a .NET code playground that shows intermediate steps and results of code compilation. Some language features are thin wrappers on top of other features -- e.g. using() becomes try/finally. SharpLab allows you to see the code as compiler sees it, and get a better understanding of .NET languages. SharpLab supports three source languages: C#/VB/F#. There are currently three targets for decompilation/disassembly: C#/IL/JIT Asm. You can use "Run" target to execute your code and see the output.
- [TryHaxe](https://try.haxe.org/) - The Haxe online playground.
- [TryItOnline](https://tio.run/) - TIO is a family of online interpreters for an evergrowing list of practical and recreational programming languages. This services supports ~700 of programming languages.

## API:
- [{JSON} Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) - Free fake API for testing and prototyping.

## Code generators:
- [QuickType](https://app.quicktype.io/) - QuickType is a tool to generate strongly-typed models and serializers from JSON, JSON Schema, TypeScript, and GraphQL queries, making it a breeze to work with JSON type-safely in many programming languages.

## Math:
- [Desmos graphic calc](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) - Graphic calculator.
- [Desmos scientific calc](https://www.desmos.com/scientific) - Scientific calculator.
- [Desmos matrix calc](https://www.desmos.com/matrix) - Matrix calculator.
- [Desmos geom tools](https://www.desmos.com/geometry) - Geometry tools.

## Art:
- [Glyphter](https://glyphter.com) - Icon font generator.

# Offline tools

#Analysers
## Math:
[Herbie](https://herbie.uwplse.org/demo/) - Herbie - a tool that tells you how to rewrite your maths expressions in a way that preserves IEEE 754 precision better.
