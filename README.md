- [SharpLab](https://sharplab.io) - SharpLab is a .NET code playground that shows intermediate steps and results of code compilation. Some language features are thin wrappers on top of other features -- e.g. using() becomes try/finally. SharpLab allows you to see the code as compiler sees it, and get a better understanding of .NET languages. SharpLab supports three source languages: C#/VB/F#. There are currently three targets for decompilation/disassembly: C#/IL/JIT Asm. You can use "Run" target to execute your code and see the output.
